Customer Management System

The purpose of the project is to apply my knowledge of some hava EE frameworks
the project uses Spring, Spring MVC, Spring AOP, Spring Security, Hibernate and MYSQL

-Spring MVC is used to create a web application that represents a customer management system where customer records can be added, viewed, updated or deleted
 the application uses a mixture of xml and annotation configurations and uses spring mvc to help provide important features such as Validation.
-Spring AOP is used to solve cross cutting concerns such as LOGGING
-Spring Security is used to provide authentication and authorization also customize the views based on the role of the user such as only admins can edit or remove records.
-Hibernate is used for ORM
-Mysql is the database the application uses for saving customer and employee data
-JSP is used to provide dynamic content with help of JSTL tags provided by spring such as spring form and security
-HTML and CSS is used to create the web pages (Which to be honest needs a lot of work to look more user friendlily)

I try to write clean code and follow best practices as I am still learning and I am refactoring the code whenever i learn new things or find a better or cleaner way to do the job.

TODO spring
    replace hardcoded messages with ones from the resources

TODO webpages
    improve the look of the webpages.
